For example, for symmetric group \\(S_3\\) the S is determined as S = \\([1, 3, 2]\\). For the direct product \\(Z_2 \\oplus Z_2\\), it is \\([1, 3]\\).</p> <p>It's known that some groups may have the same set S (see https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/729611/is-a-finite-group-uniquely-determined-by-the-orders-of-its-elements). However, if we are talking about finite abelian groups the following statement is true:</p> <p>Each set S determine unique finite abelian group</p> <p>How can we prove it? First, let's recall one of the Sylow theorems with the help of Wikipedia:</p> <p>Let p be a prime factor with multiplicity n of the order of a finite group G,  so that the order of G can be written as \\(p^nm\\), where \\(n &gt; 0\\) and p does not divide m. Let \\(n_p\\) be the number of Sylow p-subgroups of G. Then the following hold:</p> <ul> <li>\\(n_p\\) divides m, which is the index of the Sylow p-subgroup in G.</li> <li>\\(n_p \\equiv 1 \\:(mod \\: p)\\)</li> <li>\\(n_p = |G:N_G(P)|\\), where P is any Sylow p-subgroup of G and \\(N_G\\) </li> </ul> <p>Actually, we will use the fact that for any \\(p||G|\\), there exists at least one Sylow p-group, and the group G can be represented as a direct sum of its Sylow p-groups uniquely.</p>"}]}
